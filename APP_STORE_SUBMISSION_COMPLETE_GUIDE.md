- âœ… Notifications completely removed from app
- âœ… Version: 1.0.9, Build: 43 (auto-incremented by EAS)
- âœ… All functionality tested and working
- âœ… Clean build with updated EAS CLI

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Submission Process

### 1. Complete the Current Build
The build is currently running with build number 43. You have two options:

**Option A: Provide Apple Credentials (Recommended)**
- Answer "Y" to the Apple account question
- Enter your Apple Developer credentials
- This allows EAS to automatically handle certificates and provisioning

**Option B: Skip Apple Credentials**
- Answer "n" to continue without credentials
- You'll need to manually handle certificates later

### 2. Wait for Build Completion
Monitor the build progress:
```bash
eas build:list --platform ios
```

### 3. Submit to App Store Connect

Once the build completes successfully:

```bash
# Submit directly to App Store Connect
eas submit --platform ios --latest

# Or submit a specific build
eas submit --platform ios --id <BUILD_ID>
```
