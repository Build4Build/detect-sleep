# Sleep Detector Support

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does sleep detection work?
Sleep Detector uses your device's sensors and machine learning to detect when you're likely sleeping. It analyzes patterns in your device usage and movement to make these determinations.

### How accurate is the sleep detection?
The app's accuracy improves over time as it learns your patterns. You can always manually correct any incorrect detections to help improve accuracy.

### Does it drain my battery?
No, we've optimized the app to use minimal battery power. The app uses efficient algorithms and sensor polling to maintain battery life.

### How do I correct wrong sleep detections?
You can easily correct any incorrect sleep detection by:
1. Tapping on the sleep period in the timeline
2. Using the edit button to adjust the time or delete the entry

### How do I export my data?
You can export your sleep data through the Settings menu. Your data will be exported in a format you can easily read or import into other applications.

### Privacy Concerns
All your data stays on your device. We don't collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on external servers.
