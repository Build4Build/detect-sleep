# Local iOS Build Guide - Sleep Detector

## üéØ Current Situation
- EAS free tier limit reached
- Need to build locally for App Store submission
- All validation issues have been fixed

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Build Options

### Option 1: EAS Local Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Build locally using EAS
eas build --local --platform ios

# This will:
# - Build on your local machine
# - Use your local Xcode installation
# - Generate a .ipa file for App Store submission
```

### Option 2: Direct Xcode Build
```bash
# Navigate to iOS project
cd ios

# Install pods
pod install

# Open Xcode project
open SleepDetector.xcworkspace

# Then build and archive in Xcode:
# 1. Select "Any iOS Device" as target
# 2. Product ‚Üí Archive
# 3. Upload to App Store Connect
```

### Option 3: Expo CLI (Alternative)
```bash
# Using traditional Expo CLI
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

# Note: This may require additional setup
```

## üìã Prerequisites for Local Building

### Required Software:
- ‚úÖ Xcode (latest version recommended)

## üîß Local Build Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```bash
cd /Users/pierre-henrysoria/Code/detect-sleep

# Ensure latest EAS CLI
sudo npm install -g eas-cli@latest
```

### Step 2: Start Local Build
```bash
# Build locally
eas build --local --platform ios

# Follow prompts for Apple credentials
# This will generate a .ipa file
```

### Step 3: Submit to App Store
```bash
# After local build completes, find the .ipa file
# Usually in build output directory

# Submit using EAS
eas submit --platform ios --path /path/to/your/app.ipa

# Or upload manually via Xcode or Application Loader
```

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
```

#### 4. Xcode Version Issues
```bash
# Update Xcode command line tools
sudo xcode-select --install
```

### Build Locations:
- **EAS Local**: Check terminal output for .ipa location
- **Xcode Archive**: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/`

## üì§ Submission After Local Build

### Using EAS Submit:
```bash
# Submit the locally built IPA
eas submit --platform ios --path /path/to/SleepDetector.ipa
```

### Using Xcode:
1. Archive in Xcode
2. Use built-in App Store upload
3. Monitor upload in App Store Connect

### Using Application Loader:
```bash
# If you have the .ipa file
xcrun altool --upload-app --file SleepDetector.ipa --username your@email.com --password app-specific-password
```
